# Overconfidence Prevention Guide

## Problem Statement

AI-DLC was exhibiting overconfidence by not asking enough clarifying questions, even for complex project intent statements. This led to assumptions being made instead of gathering proper requirements.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Question Generation Philosophy

**OLD APPROACH**: "Only ask questions if absolutely necessary"
**NEW APPROACH**: "When in doubt, ask the question - overconfidence leads to poor outcomes"

### New Guiding Principles

1. **Default to Asking**: When there's any ambiguity, ask clarifying questions
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Evaluate ALL relevant categories, don't skip areas
3. **Thorough Analysis**: Carefully analyze ALL user responses for ambiguities
4. **Mandatory Follow-up**: Create follow-up questions for ANY unclear responses
5. **No Proceeding with Ambiguity**: Don't move forward until ALL ambiguities are resolved

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Question Generation
- Evaluate ALL question categories, don't skip any
- Ask questions wherever clarification would improve quality
- Include comprehensive question categories in each stage
- Default to inclusion rather than exclusion of questions

### For Answer Analysis
- Look for vague responses: "depends", "maybe", "not sure", "mix of", "somewhere between"
- Detect undefined terms and references to external concepts
- Identify contradictory or incomplete answers
- Create follow-up questions for ANY ambiguities

### For Follow-up Questions
- Create separate clarification files when ambiguities are detected
- Ask specific questions to resolve each ambiguity
- Don't proceed until ALL unclear responses are clarified
- Be thorough - better to over-clarify than under-clarify

## Quality Assurance

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Stages completing without asking any questions on complex projects
- Proceeding with vague or ambiguous user responses
- Skipping entire question categories without justification
- Making assumptions instead of asking for clarification

### Success Indicators
- Appropriate number of clarifying questions for project complexity
- Thorough analysis of user responses with follow-up when needed
- Clear, unambiguous requirements before proceeding to implementation
- Reduced need for changes during later stages due to better upfront clarification

## Key Takeaway

**It's better to ask too many questions than to make incorrect assumptions.** The cost of asking clarifying questions upfront is far less than the cost of implementing the wrong solution based on assumptions.
