# Error Handling and Recovery Procedures

## General Error Handling Principles

### When Errors Occur
1. **Identify the error**: Clearly state what went wrong
2. **Assess impact**: Determine if the error is blocking or can be worked around
3. **Communicate**: Inform the user about the error and options
4. **Offer solutions**: Provide clear steps to resolve or work around the error
5. **Document**: Log the error and resolution in `audit.md`

### Error Severity Levels

**Critical**: Workflow cannot continue
- Missing required files or artifacts
- Invalid user input that cannot be processed
- System errors preventing file operations

**High**: Phase cannot complete as planned
- Incomplete answers to required questions
- Contradictory user responses
- Missing dependencies from prior phases

**Medium**: Phase can continue with workarounds
- Optional artifacts missing
- Non-critical validation failures
- Partial completion possible

**Low**: Minor issues that don't block progress
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Optional information missing
- Non-blocking warnings

## Recovery Procedures

### Partial Phase Completion

**Scenario**: Phase was interrupted mid-execution

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Load the phase plan file
2. Identify last completed step (last [x] checkbox)
3. Resume from next uncompleted step
4. Verify all prior steps are actually complete
5. Continue execution normally

### Corrupted State File

**Scenario**: `aidlc-state.md` is corrupted or inconsistent

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Create backup: `aidlc-state.md.backup`
2. Ask user which phase they're actually on
3. Regenerate state file from scratch
4. Mark completed phases based on existing artifacts
5. Resume from current phase

### Missing Artifacts

**Scenario**: Required artifacts from prior phase are missing

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify which artifacts are missing
2. Determine if they can be regenerated
3. If yes: Return to that phase, regenerate artifacts
4. If no: Ask user to provide information manually
5. Document the gap in `audit.md`

## Logging Requirements

### Error Logging Format

```markdown
## Error - [Phase Name]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**Error Type**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Description**: [What went wrong]
**Cause**: [Why it happened]
**Resolution**: [How it was resolved]
**Impact**: [Effect on workflow]
```

## Prevention Best Practices

1. **Validate Early**: Check inputs and dependencies before starting work
2. **Checkpoint Often**: Update checkboxes immediately after completing steps
3. **Communicate Clearly**: Explain what you're doing and why
4. **Ask Questions**: Don't assume - clarify ambiguities immediately
5. **Document Everything**: Log all decisions and changes in `audit.md`
