# Question Format Guide

## MANDATORY: All Questions Must Use This Format

### Rule: Never Ask Questions in Chat
**CRITICAL**: You must NEVER ask questions directly in the chat. ALL questions must be placed in dedicated question files.

### Question File Format

#### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `{phase-name}-questions.md`
- Examples: `classification-questions.md`, `requirements-questions.md`, `story-planning-questions.md`

#### Question Structure
Every question must include meaningful options plus "Other" as the last option:

```markdown
## Question [Number]
[Clear, specific question text]

A) [First meaningful option]
B) [Second meaningful option]
[...additional options as needed...]
X) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)

[Answer]: 
```

**CRITICAL**: 
- "Other" is MANDATORY as the LAST option for every question
- Only include meaningful options - don't make up options to fill slots
- Use as many or as few options as make sense (minimum 2 + Other)

### User Response Format
Users will answer by filling in the letter choice after [Answer]: tag:

```markdown
## Question 1
What is the primary user authentication method?

A) Username and password
B) Social media login (Google, Facebook)
C) Single Sign-On (SSO)
D) Multi-factor authentication

[Answer]: C
```

### Reading User Responses
After user confirms completion:
1. Read the question file
2. Extract answers after [Answer]: tags
3. Validate all questions are answered
4. Proceed with analysis based on responses

### Multiple Choice Guidelines

#### Option Count
- Minimum: 2 meaningful options + "Other" (A, B, C)
- Typical: 3-4 meaningful options + "Other" (A, B, C, D, E)
- Maximum: 5 meaningful options + "Other" (A, B, C, D, E, F)

#### Option Quality
- Make options mutually exclusive
- Cover the most common scenarios
- Only include meaningful, realistic options
- **ALWAYS include "Other" as the LAST option** (MANDATORY)
- Be specific and clear

### Contradiction and Ambiguity Detection

**MANDATORY**: After reading user responses, you MUST check for contradictions and ambiguities.

#### Detecting Contradictions
Look for logically inconsistent answers:
- Scope mismatch: "Bug fix" but "Entire codebase affected"
- Risk mismatch: "Low risk" but "Breaking changes"
- Timeline mismatch: "Quick fix" but "Multiple subsystems"

#### Creating Clarification Questions
If contradictions or ambiguities detected:
1. **Create clarification file**: `{phase-name}-clarification-questions.md`
2. **Explain the issue**: Clearly state what contradiction/ambiguity was detected
3. **Ask targeted questions**: Use multiple choice format to resolve the issue

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Questions should be clear and unambiguous
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Cover all necessary information
3. **Be Concise**: Keep questions focused on one topic
4. **Be Practical**: Options should be realistic and actionable
5. **Be Consistent**: Use same format throughout all question files
